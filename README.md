A repository serving as example for the cinical psychology GitHub tutorial.

## About
This repository belongs to the private Wiki of the Clinical Psychology Department at CIMH Mannheim and is used to showcase working with GitHub.
Further R tutorials will be added.

## Examples
I toyed around with the README to illustrate how commits work.
Here, I deleted a sentence and inserted this one instead, which you can view in this [commit](https://github.com/einGlasRotwein/tutorial-klips/commit/da900bedbcc1151a92622589f1aa2d65e2ca6d32).
